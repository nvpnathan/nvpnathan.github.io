Allow myself to introduce....myself.
Technology has always been a passion of mine. I'll lead with dating myself when I started working for Gateway Computers in Highschool (Who remembers the Cows?). I'm currently a Sr. Solutions Architect at AWS. Prior to AWS, I spent the last nine years at VMware in various Pre-Sales System Engineer roles. For the last 3.5 years I was in the VMware Modern Applications Business Unit helping customers with all things Cloud Native, with a big focus on Kubernetes and the VMware Tanzu Portfolio. Priot to that I spent 5 years in VMware's Networking and Security Business Unit after the acquisition of Nicira, which ultimately became VMware NSX (SDN).
