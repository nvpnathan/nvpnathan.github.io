Allow myself to introduce....myself.
I'm currently a Sr. Staff Kubernetes SE in the Cloud Native Applications Business Unit at VMware. I focus on all things Cloud Native at VMware with an emphasis on Kubernetes. I joined VMware 8 years as a Technical Account Manager and support various customers in the realm of Cloud and End User Computing. After about a year in a half VMware acquired Nicira and I joined the Networking and Security Business Unit and supported VMware NSX as a Pre-sales SE.
